        <h2>I visited the famous places in Kabul a month ago and I have published the information of all these places on this website.</h2>
 <h2>And I enjoyed it a lot because I learned a lot from this trip</h2>
 <h2>Whenever I went from Nangarhar to Kabul, I enjoyed this route a lot because it was a very unfamiliar route.</h2>
 <h2>If you also want to enjoy these places, then check out the gallery section of the website, thank you</h2>
